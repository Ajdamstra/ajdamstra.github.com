                    <p>With a lifelong fascination for technology, I've honed my skills from an early age. Since my high
                        school days, I've delved into various aspects of computer science,
                        acquiring proficiency in languages like Java, Python, Scratch, and Block-type Java.
                        Additionally, I've gained familiarity in both Front-end and Back-end development structures.
                        Now in University, I've expanded my repertoire by studying Java further, alongside acquiring
                        knowledge in HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript for web development projects.
                        Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my expertise in Python through a substantial project slated for
                        completion over the 2024 summer. I also aspire to leverage my web development
                        skills to launch an app tailored for motorcycle enthusiasts.<br><br>
                        My journey into the realm of technology isn't confined to programming languages alone. My
                        passion for Photography, videography, and video editing grew into a freelance side gig,
                        providing me with extensive familiarity with Adobe products. Moreover, my tenure at Performance
                        Motorsports, a motorsports e-commerce company, enriched my understanding of HTML,
                        particularly in crafting tailored descriptions for eBay and Amazon listings using
                        company-specific software.<br><br>
                        I am currently a student at Michigan Technological University, working towards a bachelor's
                        degree in Computer Science, with coursework including Advanced Intro to Programming and Data
                        Structures.
                        As I continue my academic journey, my unwavering passion for technology drives me to remain
                        proactive in exploring new avenues of innovation and staying
                        up-to-date with industry advancements.</p>
